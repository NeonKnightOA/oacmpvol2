<group name="_decal" color="0 1.0 0">
-------- KEYS --------
<target key="target" name="Target">the name of the entity targetted at for projection</target>
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.
</group>

<point name="_skybox" color="0.77 0.88 1.0" box="-4 -4 -4 4 4 4">
-------- KEYS --------
<angle key="angle" name="Yaw Angle">rotation angle of the sky surfaces.</angle>
<angles key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).</angles>
<real key="_scale" name="Scale">scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.</real>
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, seperate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

Chaingun ammo. Gives the player 100 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
<real key="wait" name="Respawn Delay">time in seconds before the item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).</real>
<real key="random" name="Respawn Delay Variance">random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).</real>
<integer key="count" name="Ammo Given">sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 10).</integer>
<string key="team" name="Team Name">set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).</string>
<target key="target" name="Target">picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.</target>
<targetname key="targetname" name="Target Name">a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.</targetname>
<boolean key="notbot" name="Invisible To Bots">used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.</boolean>

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
<flag key="SUSPENDED" name="No Drop To Floor" bit="0">item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: it will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static's cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.

The item_botroam entity can be used when a bot does not roam the whole level or prefers to go to only specific areas. This (invisible) item can be placed in a map just like regular items. Nobody can actually pick up the item it's only used to attract bots to certain places of the map. The value is the weight of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific item weights are stored with the bot characters AI files ("botname"_i.c for items and "botname"_w.c for weapons) in the botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.

<flag key="AUTOCLIP" name="Auto clipping" bit="1">Sets the autoclipping spawnflag, automatically assigning q3map_clipmodel to any shaders used by the model. Use of Q3Map2 autoclipping for models is only recommended for large models with relatively few triangles in their mesh (i.e. terrain). The Q3Map2 autoclipping algorithm is a bit of a hack, and can hurt in-game performance (as well as produce erroneous clipping results) when used on small, dense models.</flag>
<flag key="AUTOLIGHTMAP" name="Auto lightmap" bit="2">Sets the forcemeta spawnflag, automatically adding q3map_forcemeta to any shaders used by the model (which, in turn, allows the model to become lightmapped). This, effectively, is the "lightmapped model" spawnflag.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
This is a premade mesh model, created in a program like Kinetix's 3d Studio Max. It is a static (non-animating) model.  Shaders can give it the appearance of motion, but no animation.  The models should be stored in a directory with the pathname: models/mapobjects. The process by which models are made is not a part of this document. Currently, models only have rotation on the Z axis.
Models do not "clip" against players or weapon hits. They are entirely non-solid. If clipping is important, The user will need to build clip brushes that are roughly the size and shape of the models.

<point name="target_speaker" color="0 .7 .7" box="-8 -8 -8 8 8 8">
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
<sound key="noise" name="Sound File">path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).</sound>
<real key="wait" name="Repeat Time">delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).</real>

<flag key="ACTIVATOR" name="Audible Only To Activator" bit="3">sound will play only for the player that activated the target.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

<flag key="SUSPENDED" name="No Drop To Floor" bit="0">item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).
